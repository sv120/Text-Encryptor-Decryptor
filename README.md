Text Encryptor and Decryptor - README

Overview
--------
This is a simple desktop application that allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** text using a **secret key**. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction and includes options to **copy** encrypted/decrypted text and **paste** text from the clipboard.

Features
--------
- Encrypt and decrypt text using a secret key.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Option to clear input and output fields.
- Support for copying text to clipboard and pasting from clipboard.

Important Notes
---------------
- This app is designed such that if you encrypt text on one device, you can decrypt it on another device as long as you have the **same secret key**.
- **Do not edit the decrypted text** as any changes made will make it impossible to decrypt it correctly.
- Remember your **secret key** as it is the **password** required to decrypt your text. If you lose it, you will not be able to retrieve the original text.
- The text encrypted in this app will only be decrypted using this app. **No other app, software, or online tool** can decrypt the text encrypted with this tool.
- It may be slow while closing because it clears memory to remove traces of your sensitive data from pc.
